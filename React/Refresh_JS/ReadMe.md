# let vs const

- used to create the variable in the programming

# Arrow function

- Arrow functions are typically shorter and simpler to write, especially for small inline functions.
- If the function body contains only a single expression, you can omit the return keyword and the braces {}. Therefore `implicit return`
- Arrow functions are commonly used for callbacks,
- Arrow functions are not hoisted, so you must declare them before they are used.
- ToDo: `How the arrow function solved the problem of this operator which exist in the normal function`.

# class in JavaScript:

- class are the bluePrint for the object

# class in Inheritance:

- when you use inheritance in JavaScript classes, you need to call `super()` in the constructor of the child class if the child class has its own constructor. The super() function calls the constructor of the parent class, allowing the child class to inherit properties and methods from the parent.
