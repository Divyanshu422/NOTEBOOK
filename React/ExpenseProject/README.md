# NoteSheet:

- `package.json` file: holds all the dependencies of the project.
- `src` folder: contains the source code
- The first file to be executed is index.js
- In React, developers create `custom HTML elements` by `embedding HTML-like syntax, known as JSX (JavaScript XML)`, directly within JavaScript files. This allows developers to combine the structure of HTML with the functionality of JavaScript to build components.
