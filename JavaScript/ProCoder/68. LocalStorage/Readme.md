# Commit 1: [ index.html && index.js ]

- Populating the html tag <span> using the localStorage.
  - But in the code we have not populated the localStorage. this is becoz we have done this using the Inspect tool using the localStorage section in the application [as shown below]

<div style="text-align: center">
<img src="./Images/1.png" alt="Alt Text" width="600">
</div>
