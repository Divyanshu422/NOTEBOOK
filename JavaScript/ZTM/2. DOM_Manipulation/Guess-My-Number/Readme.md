# Guess the number:

- A simple browser-based game where users try to guess a randomly generated secret number between 1 and 20. The application provides feedback for each guess and tracks the score and high score.

## Refactoring the code:

- In the code we have 2 conditions when user click the button:
  - either the guess number is less than or greater than the secret number: both the code block have the same code except the string shown on the ui
