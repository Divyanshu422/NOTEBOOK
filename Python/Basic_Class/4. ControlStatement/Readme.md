# Palindrome of a number in python -> forth.py

- Create/Find the reverse of a number [ third.py -> Program 3]
- compare the reverse with original number -> if equal then Number is Palindrome

# Converting the number to binary: forth.py Program

- To solve this problem we are taking String and concatenating the remainder to the string
- We have taken string becoz in case of the even number the 1st remainder is zero. so if we dont take string it will be neglected from the output.
- When converting a number to binary by repeatedly dividing by 2, we collect each remainder (either 0 or 1). Using a string to store these remainders helps preserve every remainder, including any initial zeros, which might otherwise be ignored if we used another method (like adding to an integer, which doesnâ€™t retain leading zeros).

# Guessing a number [ fifth.py ]

- In the code we have used the random module -> which has multiple functions like:
  - random(): generate random floating number btw 0 to 1.0
  - randint(a, b): generate random interger btw a and b [ both Inclusive ]

### syntax:

- Import the random module
- Syntax: `random.random()` or `random.randint(a,b)`
